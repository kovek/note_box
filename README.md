# note_box
Create sticky notes that are saved on a per-url basic.

# Installation

To get in on your chrome browser, open the extensions page and tick the developer box on the top. Then, click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the folder with the extension.

# Usage

A small green sqaure icon will appear in your extensions toolbar. Click it to create a sticky note on the current webpage (It only works on http webpages right now. Do not worry, it doesn't do anything malicious). To edit a note, double click it. To delete a note, you must set the content of the note as "delete".
